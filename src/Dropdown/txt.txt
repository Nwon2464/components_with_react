Dropdown Component 
step 1 - receive props such as "selected","onChange","whole data" from parent component
step 2 - create all dropdown elements
       - need a title of dropdown as a default and all dropdown menu should be shown including default one too
step 3 - to remove duplicate menu components, conditionally render the selected menu like if (option.menu === selected.menu) return null;
step 4 - add onClick event listener when iterating using map to invoke function with current option 
         
step 5 - toggle between styles.
step 5 - useRef for the div that covers all dropdown elements , useState to toggle dropdown menus , useEffect for when  the element is rendered onto the screen first time, we add event listener to listen to that body element  
step 6 - if user clicks on any element besides the ones created by the Dropdown (outside dropdown) = > stop body event listener from closing dropdown
       - if user clicks on an element that is created by the dropdown component (inside dropdown) = > stop body event listener from doing anything


------- dropdown outside elements = > uncontrollable
html
 body
  div#root
   ------- dropdown inside elements = > controllable

    div.ui.form
